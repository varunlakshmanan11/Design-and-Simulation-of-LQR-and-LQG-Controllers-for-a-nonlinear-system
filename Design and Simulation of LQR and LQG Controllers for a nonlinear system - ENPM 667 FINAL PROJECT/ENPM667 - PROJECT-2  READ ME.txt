ENPM667 - PROJECT-2  READ ME

General instructions 

a) Use MATLAB editor to run all the fiiles found in the folders

b) we have used the Controls system toolbox for LQG controller, kindly run the Part_G codes using the respective toolbox if its not in your system

C)Finally click run on the editor to run the file 


1)Part_C_Controllability.m -  Just a simple matlab file to find the controllability matrix and find the conditions matching the controllability

2)Part_D_LQR_for_linear_system.m - Used Lqr with the linear system 

3)Part_D_LQR_for_non_linear_system.m -Used Lqr with the non- linear system 

4)Part_E_Observability.m- Found observability using the the condtion for observability for the components as asked in the question

5)Part_F_Luenberger_observer_linear.m- Used luenberger observer on linear systems using th observable C matrices

6)Part_F_Luenberger_observer_non_lin.m- Used luenberger observer on non-linear systems using th observable C matrices

8)Part_G_LQG_Non_Linear.m- to control  non linear system - for this program we have used 'Control Systems' tool box in MATLAB
