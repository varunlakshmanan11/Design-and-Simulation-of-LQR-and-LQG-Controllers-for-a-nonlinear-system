## Design and Simulation of LQR and LQG Controllers for a nonlinear system

This is a group project of 3 Members where we designed and implemented LQR and LQG controllers for a non-linear system as part of our final project for the course ENPM - 667 Control of Robotics systems.

## General instructions 

a) Use MATLAB editor to run all the fiiles found in the folders

b) we have used the Controls system toolbox for LQG controller, kindly run the Part_G codes using the respective toolbox if its not in your system

C)Finally click run on the editor to run the file 

## File Explanations

1)Part_C_Controllability.m -  Just a simple matlab file to find the controllability matrix and find the conditions matching the controllability

2)Part_D_LQR_for_linear_system.m - Used Lqr with the linear system 

3)Part_D_LQR_for_non_linear_system.m -Used Lqr with the non- linear system 

4)Part_E_Observability.m- Found observability using the the condtion for observability for the components as asked in the question

5)Part_F_Luenberger_observer_linear.m- Used luenberger observer on linear systems using th observable C matrices

6)Part_F_Luenberger_observer_non_lin.m- Used luenberger observer on non-linear systems using th observable C matrices

8)Part_G_LQG_Non_Linear.m- to control  non linear system - for this program we have used 'Control Systems' tool box in MATLAB
